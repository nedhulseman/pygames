# Introduction tro Pygames

This code and the accompanying blog post, will give a thorough walkthrough of the pygames packages 
and a few essentials of creating your own video games. 
    1. background.py 
          This demonstrates how to make simple graphics using various shapes, as well as 
          generally how the gaming platform is created
    2. moving.py
          This demonstrates how you can make a object move accross the screen
    3. deflected.py
          Here we find out about basic collision detection
